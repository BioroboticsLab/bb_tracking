# bb_tracking

This repository holds the tracking code for the BeesBook project.

It supersedes [the tracking code used in 2015 and 2016](https://github.com/BioroboticsLab/bb_tracking_2016) (published as [Boenisch et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00035/full)) and supports different states of bees (in a cell, on the glass, unmarked, with tag).
